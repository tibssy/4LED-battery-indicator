# ATtiny85 Power Indicator

This project utilizes an ATtiny85 microcontroller to create a visual power indicator for headphones powered by a supercapacitor. It reads the supercapacitor's voltage level and illuminates a series of LEDs to represent the remaining charge, providing a convenient and low-power method for monitoring battery status.  The code includes deep sleep functionality to minimize energy consumption.
